# GEM

The second part of the course focuses on gas detectors, with particular emphasis on the GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier).

## First Experiment
In the first experiment, we measured the gain of the GEM as a function of the applied voltage. To achieve this, we first determined the rate of the Fe-55 radioactive source.


## Second Experiment
In the second experiment, we analyzed the GEM's ability to amplify the input signal across its active area. 
We placed the source at various positions on the GEM's active surface and acquired energy spectra.
By fitting the spectra, we identified the position of the photopeak (higher position = higher energy = higher amplification). 
This allowed us to map the GEM's surface and observe variations in amplification.


## Third Experiment
In the third experiment, we conducted a measurement of cosmic rays. 
We paired the GEM with two scintillators and recorded coincident events.
Using Monte Carlo simulations, we determined the geometric acceptance of the apparatus.
We then measured the system's efficiency by calculating the ratio of triple-coincident counts (GEM + both scintillators) to double-coincident counts (scintillators only) as a function of voltage.
