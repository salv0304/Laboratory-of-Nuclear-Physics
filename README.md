# Data Analysis Macros for Laboratory of Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics II

This repository contains the ROOT macros used for data analysis in the course Laboratory of Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics II at the University of Pavia.

The original scripts were provided by the course professors. In this repository, I have uploaded the modified versions that I worked on during the course. These modifications reflect my personal adjustments, optimizations, and additional functionalities added to the original scripts.
